= CMake project structure
In the article before, we create a library and an executable, however both are placed on the same directory, but we can do better than that

:toc:
:sectnums:

:imagesdir: ./assets/images/

== Introduction

So if we take a look at the folder before that one, we can see that the sources used to make a library are in the same place than the one used to make the executable.

NOTE: What we can do is creating a new folder named `src` that contains all the sources of the library

But you can also do it in another way, I usually do it another way than this one, although even if I kept this separation between app and my_lib, I used to do something more like this:

image::directory-structure-modified.png[]

NOTE: If we take into account the size of the `my_lib`, you may be thinking like there is no need to do something like this, however, what if we decide to add more features onto it ?

WARNING: However, now that we decide the directory structure like we did, we will have to tell CMake about it

== Telling CMake about changes
As we decide to change the directory structure, now we will be able to tell CMake about it, because right now, those commands won't be able to see the files:

```cmake
add_library(Library STATIC my_lib.cpp)
add_executable(executable ./main.cpp)
```

CMake can't find the specified files in the directory where it lies. So you will have to specify the path where the files are lying:

```cmake
add_library(Library STATIC my_lib/src/my_lib.cpp)
add_executable(executable app/src/main.cpp)
```

Now, after those changes, we'll be able to rebuild the entire project using the followings commands:

```sh
$ cmake -S . -B build -G "Unix Makefiles"
```

the build has been done, and it works, now if we build the project using this command:

```sh
$ cmake --build ./build
```

An error will be present:

image::cannot-find-lib.png[]

That's because we didn't tell our project where to look for the headers files. So how do we do that ?

=== Telling CMake to search the include
In order to tell CMake where the includes are located at, we have 2 options, however I've always use the same since my beggining as a software developper which is:

```cmake
target_include_directories(Library PUBLIC my_lib/include/)
target_include_directories(executable PUBLIC app/include/)
```

Both command `target_include_directories` are adding the include directories to the target.

So here is the final `CMakeLists.txt` file:
```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.28)

project(CppProjectTemplate
        VERSION 0.0.1
        LANGUAGES C CXX)

add_library(Library STATIC my_lib/src/my_lib.cpp)
add_executable(executable app/src/main.cpp)

target_include_directories(Library PUBLIC my_lib/include/)
target_include_directories(executable PUBLIC app/include/)
target_link_libraries(executable PUBLIC Library)
```

NOTE: Something to not though, is that it's not a good practice is to have a CMake at each directories where you have source and header files.

=== Create a subdirectory
As of now, we just have only one `CMakeLists.txt` file that lists all the targets that needs to be built, although it works, alright, but what if we add more target / subdirectories ? It's gonna be messy very fast ! One thing to do is by creating subdirectory.

==== Create CMake subdirectory
Take the folder `app` and `my_lib` we have, we can create then two `CMakeLists.txt` inside, because each directories (`app` and `my_lib` are compilation unit by theirselves)

image::cutting-cmake-into-subdir.png[]

The content of the two `CMakeLists.txt` files we just create on each compilation units are just that:

===== app/CMakeLists.txt
```cmake
add_executable(Executable ./src/main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(executable PUBLIC Library)
target_include_directories(executable PUBLIC ./include/)
```

===== my_lib/CMakeLists.txt
```cmake
add_library(Library STATIC ./src/my_lib.cpp)
target_include_directories(Library PUBLIC ./include/)
```

Alright, so now we have cut the default `CMake` we had before into smaller `CMakeLists.txt`, but, does CMake know that we make this change ? Absolutely not ! So we'll have to tell him like:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.28)

project(CppProjectTemplate
        VERSION 0.0.1
        LANGUAGES C CXX)

add_subdirectory(my_lib/)
add_subdirectory(app/)
```

WARNING: As we are linking the library against the app itself, you have to tell CMake to build first the library and then the application.
